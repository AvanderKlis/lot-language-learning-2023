Materials for LOT School 2023, "Language Learning: A Data-Driven Approach"

## Description

In this course, we will examine early language learning through the lens of new data resources that facilitate quantitative studies. Our framework will be the "Standard Model" of Kachergis, Marchman, and Frank (2022) that links language input to processing and learning outcomes, and we will consider the strengths and weaknesses of this model for describing vocabulary learning as well as the learning of some morphology and syntax. Our hands-on approach will involve learning the use of CHILDES and childes-db for studying language input, Wordbank for studying language outcomes, and Peekbank for studying processing. 

Prerequisite: Some knowledge of R sufficient to manipulate datasets from these resources. 

## Learning Goals

* Discuss "standard model" framework for early word learning, focusing on input, processing, and uptake constructs, 
* Learn a reproducible workflow for exploring language acquisition data in R, and
* Explore data from Wordbank, CHILDES, and Peekbank as a source of insights into language learning.
